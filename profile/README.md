Kanopi emerged from a love of treehouses.

Treehouses are amazing structures in the sky. Incredible works of craftsmanship and creativity that exist in a larger context of their surroundings. Kanopi vowed to build a web agency upon that same foundation: pairing creative solutions with sustainable and strong architecture while keeping the client’s entire ecosystem in mind.

We’re always looking for great talent. Please [check out our careers page](https://kanopi.com/careers?ref=kanopi_github_org).
